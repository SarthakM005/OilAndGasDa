In June 2018, the Norwegian Oil & Gas company Equinor announced that they would be sharing a complete set of data from the Norwegian continental shelf for research and study purposes, thus granting all academic institutions, students, and researchers permission to use this dataset in accordance with the Equinor Open Data Licence, without any need for further written permission.

The Volve production data was released in the form of an excel file made up of two (02) sheets, namely Daily Production Data and Monthly Production Data.
